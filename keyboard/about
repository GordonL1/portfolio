This includes the PCB files, footprints, and gerber files I used to create a fully custom keyboard for stenography.
Stenography is a method of typing that usually requires expensive specialty equiptment, but it also allows one to type at hundreds of words per minute, 
many times faster than regular keyboards allow.
However, I don't have the thousands of dollars required to buy one of these professional keyboards, so I decided to design my own.
The total cost of my materials was about $90, but if I didn't have to order PCBs, it would be much cheaper.
Even at the $90 price, my machine is cheaper than anything else currently available.
Additionally, I included a full number row, not present on most other machines. This number row allows for QWERTY typing as well as stenography,
and it allows one to type numbers much faster while typing code using stenography.

This machine must be paired with Plover (an open source stenography engine) to use stenography.
