# Gordon's Portfolio
Basic portfolio with some of my recent projects and other prorgamming/computer things I have worked on recently

# Current Projects
Currently I'm working on writing a basic operating system + shell in Rust. I'm using a tutorial from os.phil-opp.com to get started, but I plan on reimplementing my programming language interpreter so my OS can run prorgams in my prgramming language.

# Future Projects
I plan on expanding my programming langauge, making it more user friendly and implementing things like lists.
