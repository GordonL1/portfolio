# Gordon's Portfolio
Basic portfolio with some of my recent projects and other prorgamming/computer things I have worked on recently


# Current Projects
Currently I'm working on writing a basic operating system + shell in Rust. I'm using a tutorial from os.phil-opp.com to get started, but I'd like to reimplement my programming language interpreter so that my OS can run prorgams in my prgramming language.


# Future Projects
I plan on expanding my programming langauge, making it more user friendly, implementing things lists, and adding more built in functions.
I also plan on making an interpeter for an array language I create (like Dyalog APL, BQN, J, or K).
